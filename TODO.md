# Project Roadmap

## Main App
- [x] Implement basic functionality for the main app
- [x] Create command-line interface (CLI) for the main app
- [ ] Add graphical user interface (GUI) for the main app
  - [ ] Design the GUI layout
  - [ ] Implement GUI components
    - [ ] Navigation menu
    - [ ] Data visualization panel
  - [ ] Integrate GUI with existing functionality
  - [ ] Test and debug GUI implementation

## Game
- [x] Develop core game mechanics
- [x] Build command-line version of the game
- [ ] Add graphical user interface (GUI) for the game
  - [ ] Design the game GUI layout
  - [ ] Implement GUI components
    - [ ] Game board
    - [ ] Player interface
    - [ ] Scoreboard
  - [ ] Integrate GUI with existing game mechanics
  - [ ] Test and debug GUI implementation

## Stretch Goals
- [ ] Enhance main app GUI with additional features
- [ ] Improve game GUI with animations and visual effects
- [ ] Optimize performance of the main app and the game
- [ ] Expand game features (e.g., power-ups, multiplayer mode)
- [ ] Localize the main app and the game to support multiple languages

This roadmap outlines the planned development tasks for adding a graphical user interface (GUI) to both the main app and the game. The main app will have a comprehensive GUI with various components for navigation, user settings, and data visualization. The game will have a separate GUI featuring a game board, player interface, and scoreboard.

The implementation of the GUI will follow a step-by-step process, including design, component implementation, integration, and testing. Additionally, stretch goals have been identified to enhance the GUI and expand the game's features. Optimizing performance and localizing the app and game are also part of the long-term plan.
